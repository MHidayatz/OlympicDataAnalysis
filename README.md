# Olympic Data Analysis

This project aims to explore, analyze and visualize the vast and rich world of Olympic data. It utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage, Python for data exploration, and PowerBI for visualization.

## Repository Link

The repository for this project can be found at: [OlympicDataAnalysis](https://github.com/MHidayatz/OlympicDataAnalysis)
PowerBI file is found at [OlympicDataAnalysis_PowerBI_Report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMTY5ZjNiNjktYjMwZS00ZjMzLTk0MGEtM2U4NzRkZjEzYmExIiwidCI6IjhhMDZmZWZlLTBmNGQtNGU3YS05NzU0LTFhZmE1MWI5MmQyMCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D)

## Project Components

1. **PostgreSQL**: The PostgreSQL database management system is used to store and manage the Olympic data. This provides a robust and reliable way to handle the large quantities of data involved in this project.

2. **Python**: Python, along with libraries such as Pandas and sqlalchemy, is used for exploring the data and carrying out data analysis tasks. This includes data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.

3. **PowerBI**: PowerBI is used for data visualization, allowing us to create dynamic and interactive visual representations of the data. This provides a more intuitive understanding of the data and the insights derived from it.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/MHidayatz/OlympicDataAnalysis.git`

2. **Set Up PostgreSQL**: Next, set up your PostgreSQL database and import the Olympic data. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the `Table_Structures.ddl` file in the repository.

3. **Python Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed on your local machine. You will also need to install the necessary Python libraries used in this project. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

4. **Running the Python Scripts**: The Python scripts for data exploration can be run using any Python IDE or from the terminal. Make sure to adjust the database connection parameters in the scripts to match your PostgreSQL setup.

5. **PowerBI Setup**: Finally, open the PowerBI files to explore the pre-built visualizations. You can also create your own visualizations using the data.
